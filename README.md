**Project Overview**

Happiness plays a crucial role in enhancing individual well-being and fostering a thriving society. My research aimed to identify the key factors influencing the happiness scores of countries. Using data from the World Happiness Report, which covers indicators such as GDP, social support, family ties, perception of corruption, freedom of life choices, and trust in government, the study analyzed happiness scores from 2018 to 2021.

The analysis revealed that the most significant factor contributing to happiness was the freedom to make life choices. This insight underscores the importance of personal autonomy in fostering well-being, even though some might humorously suggest that a "No Tax" policy would be a major contributor to happiness.
